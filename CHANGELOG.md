## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **AST-based code transforms:** Replaced fragile regex-based transforms with proper AST parsing using `acorn` and `css-tree`
  - CSS Modules: `css-tree` AST for reliable class extraction and scoping (handles pseudo-selectors, nested rules, media queries)
  - ESM→CJS: `acorn` AST for precise import/export conversion (handles class exports, re-exports, `export *`, namespace imports)
  - React Refresh: `acorn` AST component detection — no longer false-detects `const API_URL = "..."` as a component
  - npm import redirect: `acorn` AST targets import/export source strings precisely, avoiding false matches in comments/strings
  - All transforms gracefully fall back to regex if AST parsing fails
- **Shared code-transforms module:** Extracted ~350 lines of transform logic into `src/frameworks/code-transforms.ts`, deduplicating `addReactRefresh()` between NextDevServer and ViteDevServer
- **New features:** CSS Modules, App Router API Routes, `useParams`, Route Groups, `basePath`, `loading.tsx`/`error.tsx`/`not-found.tsx` convention files, `next/font/local`
- **E2E test harness:** Added `examples/next-features-test.html` and `e2e/next-features.spec.ts` with 25 Playwright tests covering all new features

### Fixed

- **App Router API query params:** Fixed query string not being passed to App Router route handlers (`handleAppRouteHandler` now receives `urlObj.search`)
- **E2E import paths:** Fixed `examples/vite-demo.html` and `examples/sandbox-next-demo.html` using wrong relative import path (`./src/` → `../src/`)
- **E2E test assertions:** Fixed dynamic route test checking for `[id].jsx` string that never appears in generated HTML; fixed vite-error-overlay blocking clicks in navigation tests
- **Convex demo logging:** Added key file path logging so e2e tests can verify project files

### Dependencies

- Added `acorn` (8.15.0), `acorn-jsx` (5.3.2), `css-tree` (3.1.0)

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Asset prefix support:** NextDevServer now supports `assetPrefix` option for serving static assets with URL prefixes (e.g., `/marketing/images/...` → `/public/images/...`)
- **Auto-detection:** Automatically detects `assetPrefix` from `next.config.ts/js/mjs` files
- **Binary file support:** Macaly demo now supports base64-encoded binary files (images, fonts, etc.) in the virtual file system
- **File extraction script:** Added `scripts/extract-macaly-files.ts` to load real-world Next.js projects including binary assets

### Fixed

- **Virtual server asset routing:** Service worker now forwards ALL requests from virtual contexts (images, scripts, CSS) to the virtual server, not just navigation requests. This fixes 404 errors for assets using absolute URLs.
- **Double-slash URLs:** Handle URLs like `/marketing//images/foo.png` that result from concatenating assetPrefix with paths

## [0.2.5] - 2025-02-01

### Added

- **Transform caching:** Dev servers now cache transformed JSX/TS files with content-based invalidation, improving reload performance
- **Module resolution caching:** Runtime caches resolved module paths for faster repeated imports
- **Package.json parsing cache:** Parsed package.json files are cached to avoid repeated file reads
- **Processed code caching:** ESM-to-CJS transformed code is cached across module cache clears

### Fixed

- **Service Worker navigation:** Plain `<a href="/path">` links within virtual server context now correctly redirect to include the virtual prefix
- **Virtual FS mtime:** File system nodes now track actual modification times instead of returning current time
- **Flaky zlib test:** Fixed non-deterministic test that used random bytes

## [0.2.4] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed

- **App Router navigation:** Extended client-side navigation fix to also support App Router (`/app` directory). Both Pages Router and App Router now use dynamic imports for smooth navigation.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed

- **Next.js Link navigation:** Fixed clicking `<Link>` components causing full iframe reload instead of smooth client-side navigation. Now uses dynamic page imports for proper SPA-like navigation.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed

- **Critical:** Fixed browser bundle importing Node.js `url` module, which broke the library completely in browsers. The `sandbox-helpers.ts` now uses dynamic requires that only run in Node.js.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed

- CI now builds library before running tests (fixes failing tests for service worker helpers)

### Changed

- Added security warning to Quick Start section in README
- Clarified that `createContainer()` should not be used with untrusted code
- Added "Running Untrusted Code Securely" example using `createRuntime()` with sandbox
- Updated repository URLs to point to Macaly/almostnode

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added

- **Vite plugin** (`almostnode/vite`) - Automatically serves the service worker file during development
  ```typescript
  import { almostnodePlugin } from 'almostnode/vite';
  export default defineConfig({ plugins: [almostnodePlugin()] });
  ```

- **Next.js helpers** (`almostnode/next`) - Utilities for serving the service worker in Next.js apps
  - `getServiceWorkerContent()` - Returns service worker file content
  - `getServiceWorkerPath()` - Returns path to service worker file

- **Configurable service worker URL** - `initServiceWorker()` now accepts options
  ```typescript
  await bridge.initServiceWorker({ swUrl: '/custom/__sw__.js' });
  ```

- **Service worker included in sandbox files** - `generateSandboxFiles()` now generates `__sw__.js` along with `index.html` and `vercel.json`, making cross-origin sandbox deployment self-contained

### Changed

- Updated README with comprehensive Service Worker Setup documentation covering all deployment options

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-30

### Added

- Initial release
- Virtual file system with Node.js-compatible API
- 40+ shimmed Node.js modules
- npm package installation support
- Vite and Next.js dev servers
- Hot Module Replacement with React Refresh
- Cross-origin sandbox support for secure code execution
- Web Worker runtime option
